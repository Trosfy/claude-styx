// A plain Agent call under a routed parent. Natively a subagent with no model of its own runs on its parent's
// model, but the engine believes a routed parent is native, so styx claims the spawn: when the parent (main
// for the turn under way, or a routed subagent) is routed, the subagent gets the parent's route, which the
// turn.step hook then answers as it answers a styx agent tool subagent's. What the Agent tool decided itself
// stands: an explicit model, a definition's own model, a cwd, a teammate and a workflow agent stay native, and so
// does a subagent the engine resolved to any model but its parent's. So does one styx cannot reproduce faithfully,
// which stays native with one debug line: a custom type it has no definition for (no prompt or tool list) or finds
// more than one of, a built-in type styx cannot run (NOT_REPRODUCED), a built-in type that more than one agent file
// names, a type a hook beneath rewrote, a spawn from a subagent that works in a worktree, and an isolated subagent
// whose worktree the engine did not make.
// A fork is held to a stricter rule, because it carries its parent's whole conversation: under a routed parent it
// runs on that parent's own target, with its parent's prompt, or it is refused. It never runs natively there and
// never on another target. Only a fork whose parent is known to be native is left alone, as the engine runs it.
